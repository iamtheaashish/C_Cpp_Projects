What are the primary differences between std::string and std::string_view?

What can go wrong when using a std::string_view?

----
My Answer:

Primary difference between std::string and std::string_view is that std::string makes a copy of the value it stores while std::string_view just views the already existing copy which reduces the amount of memory we need. std::string is expensive to use. std::string is usually used to input data, pass function parameters etc. std::string_view is read only. std::string is owner.

what can go wrong with std::string_view

it can store false values if it is being initialised by temporary objects which die while the program is executing.
