1. line 18, '.\n' is wrong, it should be enclosed within double quotes.
2. maybe they should have used unsigned int, age can't be negative

I can only find 2 problems,
learncpp states these problems:
1. On line 8, age is defined as a std::uint8_t. Because std::uint8_t is typically defined as a char type, using it here will cause the program to behave as if we’re inputting and outputting a char value rather than a numeric value. For example, if the user entered their age as “18”, only the character '1' would be extracted. Because 1 has ASCII value 49, the user would be treated as if they were 49 years old. A regular int should be used to store the age, as the age doesn’t require a specific minimum integer width. We can also remove #include <cstdint>.

2. On line 13, we use the magic number 16. Although the meaning of 16 is clear from the context it is used in, using a constexpr variable with the value 16 should be preferred instead.

3. On line 18, '.\n' is a multicharacter literal that will print the wrong value. It should be double-quoted (".\n").
