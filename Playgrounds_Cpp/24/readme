I used

`g++ main.cpp add.cpp`

to compile both of them at same time to produce 'a.out' object file.

then I used
`g++ main.cpp add.cpp -o main`

to comile both of them to same time to produce 'main' object file.

if I had done `g++ main.cpp -o main` it would have been resulted to an error
and compilation would have failed.
