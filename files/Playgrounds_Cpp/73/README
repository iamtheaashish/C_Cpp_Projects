I would say my most of the logic was correct. I will rate myself 8.5/10 in this question.

also a question:

In the solution to the above quiz, why can’t variable age1 in main be constexpr?

my answer:

so const is used when value is initialized either at compile time or run time.
In this case value will be initialized during run time.

constexpr is only used when the value has to be initialized at compile time
(we are sure what the value is going to be, like value of pi, universal constants)
that helps us to make optimizations in our program.

we don't know what the value of person's age before we run the program and ask him his age.
we can only know after he inputs his age.
